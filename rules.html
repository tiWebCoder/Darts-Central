                                The game of darts focuses on both players racing to

                                the bullseye (centre of the dartboard) should be at eye level for

                                Scoring more than 180 points is not possible even in a single turn. The highest 
                                value / segment on a dartboard is 20 with its triple value equaling 60. Since a 
                                player has 3 darts, the highest value they can score in a single turn is 
                                3 x 3 x 20 = 180 points.
