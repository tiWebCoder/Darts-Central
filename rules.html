                                The game of darts focuses on both players racing to reduce their individual 
                                score down to zero first. Both players take turns throwing darts at the 
                                board and their score is reduced depending on the total scored. Whichever 
                                player reduces their score to zero first will be the winner.

                                A set of darts is required so players are able to score points. 
                                Each player will have one set of darts which is made up of three

                                the bullseye (centre of the dartboard) should be at eye level for 
                                a 6ft person which is 5ft 8inches (1.73m) from the floor.

                                Scoring more than 180 points is not possible even in a single turn. The highest

                                player has 3 darts, the highest value they can score in a single turn is 
                                3 x 3 x 20 = 180 points.
